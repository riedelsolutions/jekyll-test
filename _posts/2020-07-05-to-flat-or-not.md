In this week's Design Hell, also known as Design Twitter, the discussion sparked by Big Sur's design system remains rampant — does skeuomorphism need to come back? Is neuomorphism taking off? Does flat design suck and look boring? Did skeuomorphism run its course 7 years ago?



The short, boring answer is: it depends on a bunch of factors, including what you and clients want, time/cost. But this is not a tweet, so let's dive deeper in.

## Quick Refresh: What Do These Terms Mean?

(Skip to the [next section](#flat) right under this if you know them)



Skeuomorphism in a nutshell means design that represents items as their real-life equivalents.



The example everyone uses, because it's perfect, is the collection of early Iphone icons:

<div class = "center">
<img src = "/images/flatornot/skeuomorphism.png">
</div>

Neuomorphism is a design that emerged last year, created by [Michal Malewicz](https://twitter.com/michalmalewicz) in [this article](https://uxdesign.cc/whats-the-next-ui-design-trend-75c8b61f5c7c). In summary, it's skeuomorphism adapted to modern-day needs.

<div class = "center">
<img src = "/images/flatornot/neuomorphism.png">
</div>

Flat Design is currently the most widely-used design style for interfaces and illustrations—simple shapes, palettes, and illustrations to simplify user interfaces and create a modern look and feel.

</div>

<h2 id = "flat">Flat Design: Cost-Effective, User-Proof</h2>

One of the main arguments people in the pro-skeuomorphism side present is that all flat interfaces look the same. 90% of the times, this is true. But it's not due to lack of talent or laziness, as a lot of them say.
