Hello!

This is a quick update to let you all know I released a rough demo of some of my songs. You can find it on these platforms, as well as its meaning on [Genius](https://genius.com/albums/Keyser/Detached-demo):<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

Hopefully I will soon be able to share the higher-quality version on all major streaming platforms. Thank you for taking the time to check it out!
